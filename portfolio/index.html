                <p>The technological revolution is transforming every aspect of our lives and reshaping the fabric of society itself. It is also changing how we learn and what we learn. Factual knowledge is less valued when everything we need to know is just a tap away on our phones. In this new world, the real imperative is not to be an expert at everything, but to know how to learn, adapt, and create.</p>
